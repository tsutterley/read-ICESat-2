Contributing Code or Examples
-----------------------------
We follow a standard Forking Workflow for code changes and additions.
Submitted code goes through the pull request process for `continuous integration (CI) testing <https://github.com/tsutterley/read-ICESat-2/actions>`_ and comments.

General Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Make each pull request as small and simple as possible
- Larger changes should be broken down into their basic components and integrated separately
- Bug fixes should be their own pull requests with an associated `GitHub issue <https://github.com/tsutterley/read-ICESat-2/issues>`_
- Write a descriptive pull request message with a clear title
- Be patient as reviews of pull requests take time

Steps to Contribute
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1) Fork the repository to your personal GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button on the project `main page <https://github.com/tsutterley/read-ICESat-2>`_.  This creates your own server-side copy of the repository.
2) Either by cloning to your local system or working in `GitHub Codespaces <https://github.com/features/codespaces>`_, create a work environment to make your changes.
3) Add your fork as the ``origin`` remote and the original project repository as the ``upstream`` remote.  While this step isn't a necessary, it allows you to keep your fork up to date in the future.
4) Create a new branch to do your work.
5) Make your changes on the new branch and add yourself to the list of `project contributors <./Citations.html#contributors>`_.
6) Push your work to GitHub under your fork of the project.
7) Submit a `Pull Request <https://github.com/tsutterley/read-ICESat-2/pulls>`_ from your forked branch to the project repository.

Adding Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Examples may be in the form of executable scripts or interactive `Jupyter Notebooks <./Examples.html>`_.
Fully working (but unrendered) examples should be submitted with the same steps as above.
