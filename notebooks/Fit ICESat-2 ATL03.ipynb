The magnitude of this bias depends on the shape of the transmitted waveform, the width of the window used to calculate the average surface, and the slope and roughness of the surface that broadens the return pulse.  This transmit-pulse shape bias is also estimated using histograms calculated using photons from the Transmit Echo Path (TEP) and an estimate of the width of the histogram of received photons."
